Unscented Kalman Filters:
 *Use sigma points to approximate Prob dist to deal with non-linear process and measurement functions
  *Often better approximation than EKF
  *Don't need to calculate Jacobian

CTRV model (Constant Turn Rate and Velocity Magnitude Model):
 *Relaxes assumption of vehicle's constant velocity
  *When vehicles are turning, they move slower. So EKF's predicted position would be outside of the circular path of the car.
 *Describe velocity using Speed (v) and yaw (psi) angle
  *Vehicle moving in a straight line has a yaw rate (psi dot) of zero.
 *Prediction: find f, where x(k+1) = f(x_k, v_k).
 *Approach: Describe the change rates of the state x.
 *Assumes constant turn rate (yaw dot) and constant velocity.

Process noise:
 *Uncertainty nu_k Two noise processes:
  *v: Longitudinal acceleration noise, changes at each timestep k
  *yaw
 *How does the noise vector influence the process model
 *Sign of yaw acceleration noise

Unscented transformation:
 *Recap: issue with nonlinear process or measurement models is that predicted state distribution is usually not normal.
  *UKF goes on with normal distribution with same mean and variance as predicted distribution (an approximation)
 *Solve using sigma points (representatives of the whole distribution)
  *Transform individual points of the state space thorugh the non-linear function.
  *Calculate mean and variance of the sigma points.

Steps:
 *Choose sigma points
 *Predict sigma points (insert into process function)
 *Calculate mean and variance
 *Posterior state x_k|k, posterior covariance matrix Pk|k.
 *Consider two dimensions of the state first (px, py).

Sigma points:
 *Mean of state
 *Two points per state dimension.
 *Lambda (choose): distance of state dim sigma points from the mean state
 *Square root of matrix Pk|k: directions of the sigma points relative to the mean.
 *xk|k: first sigma point (mean)
 *first vector points
