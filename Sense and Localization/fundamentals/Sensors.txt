Sensors on a self-driving car
Two stereo cameras that act like eyes
Traffic signals may be on other side of intersection -> use special lens to give camera range to detect

(1)Radar
Stands for 'radio detection and ranging'.
*sits behind front bumpers
*Uses Doppler effect (change in frequency of radar waves) to measure velocity directly.
*Gives us velocity as an independent parameter and allows sensor fusion algorithm to converge faster.
*Generates radar maps to help with localisation.
    -Provides measurements to objects without direct line of sight. Approx 150 deg field of vision, 200m range.
    -Resolution in vertical direction limited.
    -Radar clutter: Reflection across static objects e.g. soda cans on the street or manhole covers can cause problems. -> disregard static objects.

(2)Lidar
Stands for 'light detection and ranging'.
*Infrared laser beam to det distance.
*Lasers pulsed, pulses reflected by objects. Reflections return a point cloud that represents these objects.
*Relies on difference between two or more scans to calculate velocity (as opposed to measuring it directly as with radars)
*900nm wavelength range, some use longer wavelengths -> better in rain or fog.
