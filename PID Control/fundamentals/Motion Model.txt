Motion Models

Bicycle motion model: from a car to a bicycle:
 *Ignore verticle dynamics of the model.
 *Assume front wheels like one wheel, likewise with back wheels.
 *Assume car controlled like a bicycle.
 *Yaw: Rotation of the car about the z-axis.

Frames of reference: a comparison (Localisation vs Sensor Fusion):
 *Coordinates: L uses vehicle or map coordinates, S uses only vehicle coordinates.
 *Position of car described in: L: map. S: car always assumed to be at origin of the vehicle coord system.
 *Sensor measurements in: L, S (both) vehicle coords.
 *Map: L: Map landmarks in map coordinates. S: No map.

Roll, Pitch and Yaw:
 *Roll: Rotation of the car about the x-axis.
 *Pitch: Rotation of the car about the y-axis.
  *Important in hilly places.

Odometry: Motion sensor data:
 *Commonly from wheel sensors (number of wheel rotations -> distance travelled)
 *Errors on
  *wet (slipping wheels travel less than expected + slide when braking) roads or
  *bumpy roads (overestimates distance since car moves up and down vs assumed it doesn't move vertically).
