Vehicle Models:
 *Models that describe how the vehicle moves
 *Tradeoff between tractability and accuracy of models
 *Kinematic and dynamic models:
  *Kinematic models
   *Ignore tire forces, gravity and mass
   *Work better at low and moderate speeds
  *Dynamic models
   *May encompass tire forces, longitudinal and lateral forces, inertia, gravity, air resistance, drag, mass, and the geometry of the vehicle
   *May even take internal vehicle forces into account - for example, how responsive the chassis suspension is

Vehicle State [x,y,?,v]:
X, y coordinates
Orientation
Velocity

Kinematic models:
Actuators [d,a]:
Actuator inputs allow us to control the vehicle state.
Most cars have three actuators:
 *the steering wheel
 *the throttle pedal and
 *the brake pedal.
For simplicity we'll consider the throttle and brake pedals as a singular actuator, with negative values signifying braking and positive values signifying acceleration.
Simplified:
 *d for steering angle and a for acceleration (throttle/brake combined).
x = x + v cos(psi) dt 
y = y + v sin(psi) dt
v=v+a*dt
 *a in [-1,1]
?=?+(v/L_f)*d*dt
 *Add multiplicative factor of the steering angle, d, to ?
 *L_f measures the distance between the front of the vehicle and its center of gravity.
  *The larger the vehicle, the slower the turn rate.
  *Testing the validity of a model:
   *If the radius of the circle generated from driving the test vehicle around in a circle with a constant velocity and steering angle is similar to that of your model in the simulation, then you're on the right track.
