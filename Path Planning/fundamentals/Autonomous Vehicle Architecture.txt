Vehicle Subsystems

Sensors
 *Hardware components that gather data about the environment
 *Lidars, radars, cameras, GPS systems, IMU (inertial measurement units), ultrasonic sensors.

Perception
 *Software to process sensor data (to understand the environment).
 *e.g. processing videos from a camera to detect other vehicles.
 *Further division into two subsystems:
  *Detection: understanding the surrounding environment
   *E.g. Lane detection, traffic sign and traffic light detection and classification, object detection and tracking (using camera, lidar and radar data), free space detection.
  *Localisation: using sensor (primarily lidar) and map data to determine the vehicle's precise location.

Planning
 *For behaviour planning, short and long range path planning.
 *Route planning (high level path of the vehicle between two points on a map)
 *Prediction: Estimates what actions other objects may take in the future.
 *Behaviour: What maneuver(s) our vehicle should take.
 *Trajectory: What trajectory is best for the desired behaviour?

Control
 *Ensures vehicle follows paths generated by the planning subsytem.
 *Sends steering commands to the vehicle.
